        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            üëã Hello, I'm Khaleel Abdallah!
At just 14 years old, I‚Äôve built a strong passion for coding and creating impactful digital projects. Despite my age, I‚Äôm skilled in 
frontend, backend, mobile and software development, and I‚Äôm confident in my ability to handle professional challenges in these fields. I‚Äôve worked on several 
projects, including this personal portfolio website, a translator app, a spelling bee website that‚Äôs soon to be published, 
and many other unpublished projects that reflect my growth as a developer. While I‚Äôm currently still a secondary school student in S.S.1, my dedication 
to coding has pushed me beyond my years, allowing me to confidently apply for backend and frontend development roles. As a proud Muslim 
and a determined individual, I never let obstacles hold me back. Being a sickle cell patient has taught me resilience, and I channel that 
strength into everything I do. When I‚Äôm not coding, I enjoy playing football and taking on new challenges to grow personally and professionally.
Feel free to connect with me at (+234) 0906 626 7266, or explore more about my work through my portfolio website. Fun fact: I might not like bananas, 
but I absolutely love creating beautiful, functional code!
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm proficient in backend and frontend development and I aim to contribute to the tech world by building innovative solutions.
        </p>
